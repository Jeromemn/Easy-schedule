# Easy-Schedule 

## Description
This project is currently a day planner, which allows the user to enter information into time slots and save them to assist with managing time. Future addition to this project would be creating an option to add events to future dates, using a datepicker, time selection, input and button. 
The motivation with this project was to create a easy to use day planner to help with time management and scheduling appointments. 

In this project i learned to use Jquery to manipulate the DOM and create HTML elements also styled using Jquery. I learned to set a create a empty variable in situations where pulling from the local storage is needed but local storage could be empty. 

## Installation

No installation is needed, this is a web application which can be found at:
